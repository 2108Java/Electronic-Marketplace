Users can add an item to the cart by clicking its "Add to Cart" button.

In the shopping cart, the user gets an overview of the items in their cart. They can empty the cart (either by individual item or entirely), shop more, which will persist their cart and take them back to shop for more items, or checkout which will prompt their for their credit card information and simulate a purchase.
